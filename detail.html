     <strong><h1>Formovie’s Cinema Edge is an affordable 4K UST projector</h1></strong>
    <p>By <a href="">Guillermo Kurten and Nick Perry</a> Updated August 28, 2024 9:31AM</p>

    <p>
      Projector maker Formovie Technology today announced a new, more affordable <a href="">ultra short throw (UST) projector</a> to its lineup. <br>
      The Formovie Cinema Edge is a reasonably priced $2,500 projector with solid brightness and color specs, as well as Google TV with native Netflix built in. <br>
      Formovie is offering the Cinema Edge at a special preorder discounted price of $2,200 starting today. <br>
    </p>  
    <p>
      The Chinese company, which also sells projector screens and compact projectors under its <a href="">Xming sub-brand</a>, launched its Formovie 
      Theater UST projector in September 2022 to wide acclaim. The Cinema Edge takes some of what the $3,500 (at launch) Formovie Theater offers, 
      makes some improvements, and dials a few things down to make for a capable and much more affordable projector
    </p>  

    <p>
      Available September 10, the Cinema Edge offers 1,900 ISO lumens of brightness, and with its 0.23:1 throw ratio, it can throw a 100-inch <br>
      image onto your screen or wall from just 9 inches away, which is what makes UST projectors such a big draw for those with limited space. <br>
      But if that’s not enough, the projector’s image size can hit a massive 150 inches, too. In contrast, the Formovie Theatre was capped at 1,800 ISO lumens. <br>

      The Cinema Edge not only runs on the <a href="">Google TV operating system</a> (instead of Android TV), but like several newer projectors on the market running Google TV, <br>
      it also comes with Netflix preloaded — no more complicated side-loading of the <a href="">video streaming app </a> — so users can get up and running faster. Of course, <br>
      with three HDMI 2.1 ports (with one eARC), you can also connect your favorite <a href="">streaming device</a> , like an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Picture-wise, the Formovie Cinema Edge covers 110% of the Rec. 709 color gamut, which should translate to excellent color reproduction for your movie and TV watching. <br>
      Additionally, the projector features a 3000:1 contrast ratio, as well as HDR10 support (although no Dolby Vision, like its Formovie Theater cousin). We’ll have to get our <br>
      hands on it to test out how it performs in bright and dark room situations. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Cinema Edge drops the height-channel capabilities of the Formovie Theater’s <br>
      Dolby Atmos and instead includes Dolby Audio, which can still produce some excellently immersive audio. <br>
      It also features two 15-watt internal speakers with Dolby Audio and DTS-X support. It’s likely you’ll <br>
      still need to add one of the best soundbars to the setup for better sound. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With setup features such as motorized focus and 8-point keystone correction, the Cinema Edge should be a <br> 
      cinch to get configured and up and running. Gamers will be happy to see a game mode feature that offers <br>
      a refresh rate of 4K at 60Hz and a 41.9 millisecond response time <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      UST projectors do tend to be larger than compact and regular-throw projectors, but because they can sit on your <br>
      media unit under your screen or wall, they don’t get in the way. <br>
      The Formovie Cinema Edge measures 18 by 12 by 3.5 inches and weighs 15 pounds. <br>
